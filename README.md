# ThrillYatra-Adventure-Management-System

Developed a full-stack adventure management and booking system using Spring Boot (Java 21) with a microservices architecture covering authentication, adventure management, booking, and reviews. 
Implemented JWT-based security and a centralized API Gateway to ensure secure and controlled inter-service communication.
Integrated a centralized ASP.NET Core logging service to collect structured logs from all microservices for effective monitoring and debugging. 
Built a responsive and modern frontend using React (Vite) with Redux Toolkit, React Router, and Tailwind CSS. 
The system enables users to browse, book, and cancel adventures and submit reviews, while admins manage categories, adventures, and bookings. 
Designed the application to be secure, scalable, and production-ready using relational databases and industry-standard microservices practices.
