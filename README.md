# ThrillYatra-Adventure-Management-System
ThrThrillYatra is a full-stack adventure management and booking platform built using a microservices architecture. The backend is developed with Java Spring Boot (Java 21) and consists of independent services for authentication, adventure management, booking, and reviews, while a dedicated Payment Service built with Microsoft .NET (ASP.NET Core) handles secure payment processing and refund workflows. All backend services are secured using JWT-based authentication and routed through a centralized API Gateway.

The platform supports online payments, booking cancellation with refund policies, and post-adventure reviews, ensuring a secure and seamless user experience. Designed following industry-standard microservices principles, ThrillYatra is scalable, loosely coupled, and supports independent service deployment.

The frontend is built using React with Vite for high performance and fast builds. Redux Toolkit manages global state, React Router handles navigation, and Tailwind CSS provides a responsive and modern user interface. ThrillYatra is production-ready and suitable for real-world adventure management applications.
